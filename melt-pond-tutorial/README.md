## Summary 


### Access coincident sea ice and ocean data to study melt pond characteristics

Notes:

* Help user narrow down the amount of data needed for a given need. Especially relevant when working with big data volumes. Some data is cloud-based, some is still on prem, user can work with both types of data regardless of whether in the cloud or not.

* subset by bounding box
* Harmony (L2SS) API
* OPeNDAP (cloud) - TBD

Data and Resources:

* sea ice (NSIDC)
* MODIS SST L2 (PODAAC) 
* SMAP SSS L3 (PODAAC) (if available)

## Key Learning Objectives

1. TBD...
