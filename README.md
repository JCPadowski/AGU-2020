# AGU-2020

This repository contains materials for the 2020 AGU Fall Meeting Workshop: [SCIWS8 - Working with Cloud-Based NASA Earth Observations Data and Tools](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/meetingapp.cgi/Session/105465)

This workshop, hosted by NASA's Physical Oceanography and National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Centers (PO.DAAC and NSIDC DAAC), is presented in three parts:

| Topic                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                             | Time (UTC)                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Part I: Welcome: Overview and Context for NASA EOSDIS evolution to the Cloud | Presentation with Q&A                                                                                                                   | 16:00 - 16:35                                                                                                 |
| Part II: Science Use Case Demonstrations                                     | Jupyter Notebook demonstrations, highlighting NASA EOSDIS tools and services applied across several science use cases (15 min each)     | Demonstrations: 16:35 - 17:05 Break: 17:05 - 17:15 Demonstrations cont'd 3-6: 17:15-18:15  Break : 18:15 - 18:45 |
| Part III: Hands-on data discovery, access, and analysis in the cloud         | Jupyter Notebook tutorial providing step-by-step guidance on cloud-based data access and cloud compute based on previous demonstrations | 18:45 - 21:00 (including 5-min break and wrap up)                                                             |


## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the proposed workshop, participants would have a better understanding of what the new cloud-based paradigm for data archiving, distribution, and particularly data access and use would mean for them, and their science or application workflow, and would serve as a building block to enable and support the participants to thrive in the new big data paradigm. The participants will be engaged on three different levels: (1) through an overview of why and how NASA EOSDIS and data centers are moving to a cloud-based archive and distribution model, along with a discussion of how data user workflows and cost model look like in this new paradigm; (2) through a range of science use case demos of capabilities available, meant to ease the data discovery, processing, access, and use; and (3) through hands-on guided tracks to explore some of these capabilities and opportunities within the context of their own use cases.These learning objectives facilitate and encourage discussion and reflection on how the Earth and Space science, data science and informatics communities are evolving, including the acquisition, archiving, distribution, and use of big data, and how that evolution impacts scientific research and application of Earth observations, both the challenges and the opportunities. The workshop aims to bring together participants from across several Earth science disciplines, including oceanography, cryosphere, hydrology, coastal, and informatics communities. Despite the virtual nature of the workshop, organizers are looking to leverage modern technology to promote and support discussion, interaction, and co-creation among participants, and exploration of the potential of the cloud to enable science in ways we haven’t thought of before. Through workshop surveys, the organizing data centers will be able to take the pulse of the Earth and informatics scientific communities during this time of change and opportunity when it comes to Earth observations, big data, and cloud computing.

Participants should leave having a better understanding of how cloud-based NASA data and services can best be leveraged and integrated within their own work.

## Logistics
- BinderHub
- Running locally

Cloud experience not necessary. Have own computer ready for hands-on portion of the workshop.

The tutorial will be presented as a series of Python-based Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on sea ice height and ice surface temperature data from NASA’s ICESat-2 and MODIS missions, respectively, to characterize Arctic sea ice. No coding experience or computing prerequisites are required, though some familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks is recommended. The in-person tutorial utilized a JupyterHub environment that was preconfigured with the dependencies needed to run each operation in the series of notebooks. For those of you interested in running the notebooks outside of the in-person event, see below for details on how to run using Binder and Conda.

## Purpose
1. Collaboration space for PO.DAAC and NSIDC to develop AGU workshop notebooks, tutorials, and other materials (e.g. ppt slide deck).
2. Repo for workshop participants to refer to before, during, and after workshop.
3. Link to repo if spinning up a JupyterHub during workshop.
