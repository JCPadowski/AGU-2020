# AGU-2020
___

This repository contains materials for the 2020 AGU Fall Meeting Workshop: [SCIWS8 - Working with Cloud-Based NASA Earth Observations Data and Tools](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/meetingapp.cgi/Session/105465)

This workshop, hosted by NASA's Physical Oceanography and National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Centers (PO.DAAC and NSIDC DAAC), is presented in three parts: 

| Topic                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                             | Time (UTC)                                                                                                    |

| Part I: Welcome: Overview and Context for NASA EOSDIS evolution to the Cloud | Presentation with Q&A                                                                                                                   | 16:00 - 16:35                                                                                                 |
| Part II: Science Use Case Demonstrations                                     | Jupyter Notebook demonstrations, highlighting NASA EOSDIS tools and services applied across several science use cases (15 min each)     | Demonstrations 1-2: 16:35 - 17:05 Break: 17:05 - 17:15 Demonstrations 3-6: 17:15-18:15  Break : 18:15 - 18:45 |
| Part III: Hands-on data discovery, access, and analysis in the cloud         | Jupyter Notebook tutorial providing step-by-step guidance on cloud-based data access and cloud compute based on previous demonstrations | 18:45 - 21:00 (including 5-min break and wrap up)                                                             |


Introduction an overview of the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) evolution to the cloud, what it means to the Earth Observations data users, and guide participants through interactive demos that highlight data discoverability, accessibility, and usability capabilities, on and off the cloud. These demos run through science and applications user stories and workflows, which range across disciplines, including ocean, hydrology, cryosphere, and coastal. Following the demos, participants will have the chance to further explore these cloud-based capabilities with jupyter notebooks (python), familiarize themselves with setting up an AWS cloud environment, or taking a deeper dive with analysis-in-place to explore opportunities cloud can offer, by choosing one of these hands-on tracks. Participants should leave having a better understanding of how cloud-based NASA data and services can best be leveraged and integrated within their own work.

The NSIDC DAAC provides a wide variety of remote sensing data on the cryosphere, often with disparate coverage and resolution. This tutorial will demonstrate our data discovery, access, and subsetting services, along with basic open source resources used to harmonize and analyze data across these diverse products. The tutorial will be presented as a series of Python-based Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on sea ice height and ice surface temperature data from NASAâ€™s ICESat-2 and MODIS missions, respectively, to characterize Arctic sea ice. No coding experience or computing prerequisites are required, though some familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks is recommended. The in-person tutorial utilized a JupyterHub environment that was preconfigured with the dependencies needed to run each operation in the series of notebooks. For those of you interested in running the notebooks outside of the in-person event, see below for details on how to run using Binder and Conda.

Cloud experience not necessary. Have own computer ready for hands-on portion of the workshop.

## Purpose
1. Collaboration space for PO.DAAC and NSIDC to develop AGU workshop notebooks, tutorials, and other materials (e.g. ppt slide deck).
2. Repo for workshop participants to refer to before, during, and after workshop.
3. Link to repo if spinning up a JupyterHub during workshop.
